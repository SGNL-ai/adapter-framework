# Cancel previous workflows on the PR branch when there are multiple fast commits.
# `head_ref` is the name of the PR branch and is defined only on pushes to a PR branch. Thus, it
# creates a concurrency group for all commits to a PR branch, cancelling previous workflows.
# When a PR is merged into main, `head_ref` is undefined, so `run_id` is used and a unique
# concurrency group is created for each commit to main, meaning no previous workflows are cancelled.
# Reference: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-using-a-fallback-value
